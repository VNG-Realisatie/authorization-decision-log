# Information Management and Compliance {#information-management}

This, non-authoritative, section addresses the governance, security, and privacy-compliance aspects of managing an Authorization Decision Log (ADL).

Conformance to this standard does not, by itself, guarantee legal or regulatory compliance. The implementing organization is solely responsible for ensuring its implementation adheres to all applicable frameworks, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR / AVG) and relevant security baselines, such as [[?ISO/IEC 27001:2022]], [[?ISO/IEC 27002:2022]], and [[?BIO2]]. Each organization is responsible for its own Authorization Decision Log. There is no central log, although logs of several organizations can be aggregated if desired.

The following sections list aspects that should be taken into consideration when creating a compliant and secure logging solution.

## Legal and Privacy Compliance

Logging authorization decisions creates a new processing of data, which must be compliant with privacy regulations if personal data is involved.

### Purpose Limitation

When collecting personal data, the specific purposes for logging (e.g., operational auditing, forensic analysis, citizen accountability) must be defined and documented in a formal policy before implementation. Data collection must be limited to these defined purposes.

### Data Minimization

A core principle is to avoid storing unnecessary information, especially sensitive data. The goal is to make the log precise, compact, and manageable. Instead of duplicating large amounts of (personal) data, prefer storing only the data used in the decision or even just a reference that allows the state at the time of the decision to be recreated.

A logging policy must be implemented to manage what is logged based on risk. When logging sensitive data for high-risk use cases, this should be explicitly documented and approved.

Implementers should consider pseudonymization and anonymization for personal data. For example, personal identifiers can be hashed or aliased and location data can be randomized.

When aggregate statistics, such as decisions per type per time period, are sufficient, implementers should consider using aggregation as a method of data minimization and anonymization.

### Data Retention

A data retention policy must be defined and enforced. Retention periods must be based on the defined purposes and legal obligations. These may differ for different types of log entries.

As a general guideline, operational logs (for debugging, support) should be retained for a short period (months), while forensic/audit logs  may be retained for longer periods (years).

Logs that have exceeded their defined retention period must be automatically and securely purged.

### Transparency and Subject Rights

If logs contain personal data, they must be able to comply with data subject access requests.

The log's structure, purpose, and retention must be documented in the organization's Register of Processing Activities.

A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) must be conducted for any implementation that involves large-scale or high-risk processing of personal data.

## Access Control

Access to log data should be restricted based on the principle of least privilege.

It is essential to define clear policies for authorizing access to the Authorization Decision Log or parts thereof. These decisions to provide or deny access to the log should also be included in the Authorization Decision Log.

Common and important usage policies include:

* **(Forensic) Audits**: The log is a critical tool for auditing and forensic analysis after a security incident or data breach. It can help determine what actions were permitted at a specific time and on what basis, even if that permission was technically correct but improper in hindsight.
* **Observability in Trust Frameworks**: The log offers a structured method for data users to provide insight into their data usage to data providers when required, as may be required in trust frameworks. It thus offers an implementation standard for "Observability services" as defined for data spaces under the EU Data Act.
* **Debugging and Support**: The log can be a useful tool for determining why the authorization is not working as expected. It can also contain highly sensitive data, however, so it's essential to carefully define if, and under which conditions, the Authorization Decision Log can be used for this purpose.

## Security and Integrity

The log must be protected against unauthorized access, modification, and deletion.

Key concerns for ensuring security and integrity include:

- **Transport Security**: It's recommended to use mTLS (Mutual Transport Layer Security) for network connections that transport log data to ensure authenticated and encrypted transport.
- **Encryption at Rest**: All log data should be encrypted at rest. It's recommended to manage this using a Key Management System (KMS).
- **Data Integrity**: The log should be configured as append-only storage (WORM) to prevent undetected modification or deletion. Mechanisms such as a cryptographic hash chains and periodic cryptographic sealing can be used to ensure integrity and non-repudiation of logs.
- **Time Synchronization**: All systems involved in generating and storing logs should be synchronized to a trusted Network Time Protocol (NTP) source to ensure a reliable and accurate timeline of events.
- **Ingestion**: The logging endpoint should be implemented as idempotent writes to an asynchronous, buffered service (e.g., using a durable queue) to mitigate latency and availability risks in the event of log-ingest failures.
