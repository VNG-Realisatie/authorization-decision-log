# Introduction

The Authorization Decision Log standard defines a standard method for logging authorization decisions. The standard builds on the information models defined by [[AuthZen]] to log decisions. 

Additionally, it offers a structure for recording environmental factors that affected the evaluation decision. These are separated into active policies, additional information sources and configuration of the evaluation engine as per the architectural components introduced by [[NIST.SP.800-162]], also known as the "PxP" architecture.

## Purpose of this standard

This standard defines a uniform approach for logging authorization decisions, enabling organizations to provide effective accountability for historical decisions. 

The standard provides a structured format for all contextual and environmental parameters that affect decisions. A full implementation of the standard allows historical decisions to be replayed for analysis.

### Applicability

Functionally, the standard is applicable to any API request. Organizationally, it applies to Dutch governmental bodies — such as the central government, provinces, municipalities, and water boards — as well as institutions in the public or semi-public sector.

### Target Audience

The target audience for the standard includes organizations involved in making and accounting for access decisions, both within their own organization and in collaborations with other parties. This may include the Dutch government and other relevant authorities.

## Terminology 

The following list defines terminology used throughout this document.

**Authorization**

Authorization is the process of deciding whether to, fully or partially, allow or deny requests for processing (API requests) and enforcing these decisions.

**Externalized Authorization Management**

Externalized Authorization Management (EAM) is an architectural pattern in which authorization decisions are made outside of the applications that enforce the decision. 

**Log**

A structured record of events, called log records, generated by a service. Logs are intended for operational monitoring, auditing, and troubleshooting.

**Log record**

A single unit of information within a log, representing one recorded event. Each log record is immutable once written and collectively forms the log.

**Policies**

A set of one or more rules that determine whether a request should be allowed or denied.

**Source**

A source of one or more pieces of information, such as attributes or policies, which affected an authorization decision and which come from a single source.

When a source is later queried for historical information, a single identifier, such as a version, hash, or timestamp, should be sufficient to retrieve all historical information from that source.

**Replay**

The recreation of the environment in which an authorization decision took place, allowing for analysis of historical decisions.
