The Authorization Decision Log standard defines a standard method for logging authorization decisions to allow or deny API requests based on the [[AuthZen]] standard.

## Purpose of this standard

This standard defines a uniform approach for logging authorization decisions in such a way that organisations can provide effective accountability for historical decisions. 

The standard provides a structured format for all contextual and environmental parameters that affect decisions. A full implementation of the standard allows historical decisions to be replayed for analysis.

### Applicability

Functionally, the standard is applicable to any API request. Organisationally, it applies to Dutch governmental bodies—such as the central government, provinces, municipalities, and water boards—as well as institutions in the (semi-)public sector.

### Target Audience

The target audience for the standard includes organisations involved in making and accounting for access decisions, both within their own organisation and in collaborations with other parties. This may include the Dutch government and other relevant authorities.

## Terminology 

The following list describes terminology and its meaning as used in this document.

**Externalized Authorization Management**

Externalized Authorization Management (EAM) is an architectural pattern in which authorization decisions are made outside of the applications that enforce the decision. 

**Log**

**Log record**

A single unit of information within a log, representing one event recorded by a service. A log record typically includes a timestamp, severity level, event identifier, and optional metadata. Each log record is immutable once written and collectively forms part of the system’s audit and diagnostic trail.

**Message**

A structured set of names and types; also commonly referred to as a 'class' or 'type'.


**Policies**

A set of one or more rules which determine whether a request should be allowed or denied.

**Source**

A source of environmental parameters which affected an authorization decision which can be retrieved given a provided identifier.

**Replay**

The recreation of the environment in which an authorization decision took place to allow for evaluation and exploration of historical decisions.
